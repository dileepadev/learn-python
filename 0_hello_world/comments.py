# 1. This is a single-line comment
# Comments are ignored by Python and are used to explain code
print("Hello, world!")  # This prints a message to the screen

# 2. Using comments to explain calculations
x = 10  # Assign 10 to variable x
y = 5   # Assign 5 to variable y

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = x + y       # Addition
diff_result = x - y      # Subtraction
prod_result = x * y      # Multiplication
div_result = x / y       # Division

# 3. Print the results
print("Sum:", sum_result)         # Shows the sum
print("Difference:", diff_result) # Shows the difference
print("Product:", prod_result)    # Shows the product
print("Division:", div_result)    # Shows the division

# 4. Multi-line comments using triple quotes
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can be used to explain longer pieces of code.
Python ignores everything inside triple quotes.
