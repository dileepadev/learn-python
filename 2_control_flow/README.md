# Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. It determines the path a program takes based on conditions and decisions.

These are some of the popular control flow statements in Python:

1. **Conditional Statements:**
Conditional statements allow the execution of certain parts of the code based on the evaluation of expressions.
   1. [If](if.ipynb)
   2. [If...Else](if_else.ipynb)
   3. [If...Elif...Else](if_elif_else.ipynb)

2. **Looping Statements:**
Looping statements allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or a sequence.
   1. [While Loop](while_loop.ipynb)
   2. [For Loop](for_loop.ipynb)

3. **Control Statements:**
These statements can change the normal flow of loops.
   1. [Break](break.ipynb)
   2. [Continue](continue.ipynb)
   3. [Pass](pass.ipynb)
